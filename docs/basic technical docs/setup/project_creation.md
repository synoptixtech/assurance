# Creating a Project

A Project sits within a System:

{: .note-title }
> Definition: Project
>
> A project in Synx-Assure is a "use case" or instantiation of a system, for which you are developing a specific assurance argument. Each system can have multiple projects. Defining the project is an important consideration, as this is the level at which you will develop your model.
