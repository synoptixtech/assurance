# Composition of an Assurance Case

An assurance case is not simply lines and boxes on a page; it is a structured argument. This concept is vital - every element that you add has to build your argument. 

The four fundamental components of how you build an assurance case using our Aegis framework are claims, arguments, evidence, and risk. 

| Key Element 	| Definition 	| Visual Representation 	|
|-------------	|------------	|-----------------------	|
| Claim       	|A proposition the assurance case seeks to support (e.g., that a property/requirement holds).    | ![claim](..\..\..\assets\platform_screenshots\claim_clip.png)                |
| Argument    	| The reasoning step that warrants a (parent) Claim by invoking sub‑claims and/or evidence.     | ![argument](..\..\..\assets\platform_screenshots\argument_clip.png)             |
| Evidence    	| Concrete artefacts that substantiate Arguments and/or Mitigations (e.g., test reports, analyses).    |  ![evidence](..\..\..\assets\platform_screenshots\evidence_clip.png)   	      |
| Risk        	| A threat to the credibility or validity of a Claim or Argument.                       | ![risk](..\..\..\assets\platform_screenshots\risk_clip.png)                 |
